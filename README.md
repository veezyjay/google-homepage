This project is from The Odin Project's curriculum(http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).
It is about learning to replicate the google.com homepage
Main challenge is how to position items to look exactly the way it looks on google
CSS Skills are very important for this to work out well
